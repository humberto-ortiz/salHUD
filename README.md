This prototype currently uses
[atlaspr](https://github.com/commonwealth-of-puerto-rico/atlaspr/),
one of the API's released for the hackathon by the government of
Puerto Rico, to render interactive maps of the island. You can see the
[demo live](http://www.hpcf.upr.edu/~humberto/salHUD/). The
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has a [github
repository](https://github.com/commonwealth-of-puerto-rico) with more
than a dozen free software projects.
